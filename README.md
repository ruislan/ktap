### About Seed

* Initialize data through the command "pnpm seed:dev", A small amount of data will be initialized, but it covers almost all used scenarios, such as users, games, comments, replies, tags, gifts, etc. Can be used to develop and test functionality.
* Initialize the data through the command "pnpm seed:steam". The initialized content includes basic data and users and all steam games in the gameList (downloaded through the steam api). After the service is started, enter the url "/admin-panel", you can see a ðŸš€ button in some pages. Click it to generate a huge amount of data, like users, reviews, comments and so on. !!!Note, this command will clear database and re-initialize it.

### Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Build with

* Language: NodeJS v20
* Web Framework: Fastify
* Front Framework: ReactJS
* Styling: BaseWeb UI
* Database: SQLite(v1.2.0) MySQL(^v1.5.0)
* ORM: Prisma
* Other Libs:
  * day-fns: date helper
  * photoswipe: explore and scale images
  * swiper
  * tiptap: amazing editor
  * sanitize-html
  * nodejieba: Chinese word segmentation
  * nodemailer: email helper
  * node-cache: simple cache
  * node-cron: simple schedule

Note: from version v1.5.0 the database was changed from SQLite to MySQL. There are many differences between SQLite and MySQL, Therefore, versions after v1.5.0 will not be compatible with previous versions.

By the way. SQLite is great for development, demonstration, local storage and personal play, with high efficiency and good performance.
